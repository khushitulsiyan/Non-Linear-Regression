# Non-Linear-Regression

Non-linear regression is a method to model the non-linear relationship between the independent variables  洧논  and the dependent variable  洧녽 . Essentially any relationship that is not linear can be termed as non-linear, and is usually represented by the polynomial of  洧녲  degrees (maximum power of  洧논 ). For example:

 洧녽=洧녩洧논3+洧녪洧논2+洧녫洧논+洧녬 
 
Non-linear functions can have elements like exponentials, logarithms, fractions, and so on. For example:
洧녽=log(洧논)
 
We can have a function that's even more complicated such as :
洧녽=log(洧녩洧논3+洧녪洧논2+洧녫洧논+洧녬)
